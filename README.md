## My process

### Built with

- HTML

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

CSS code got messy really quickly. 

### Continued development

Need to be more aware of top down approach when planning styling, so that less code is repeated. Need to refrain from jumping around the elements, should plan carefully from top down.
